<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>

<p>Espresso is an implementation of <a href="http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/">Caffe</a>, a framework for deep learning, in the <a href="http://halide-lang.org/">Halide</a> image processing language. It will support fine-tuning of deep neural networks to achieve high performance of training and evaluation on multiple platforms.</p>

<h3>
<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p>Caffe is a framework for convolutional neural networks that allows users to define deep learning models and optimization using configuration files rather than hard-coding them. The framework prides itself on its training and evaluation speeds through the use of GPU processing. It is widely employed in research, prototyping, and large scale applications requiring speed such as computer vision and speech processing.</p>

<p>Halide is a programming language embedded in C++ designed for implementing high-performance image processing pipelines. It simplifies implementation by decoupling algorithms (the computations required to solve a problem) from their scheduling (the order, locality, and storage work should be executed with). This allows for performance fine-tuning on multiple platforms without significantly modifying the structure of code.</p>

<p>In this project, we are interested in exploring the possibility of implementing neural networks using the Halide philosophy, so that neural network code can enjoy both maintainability and high performance. By utilizing a compiler that is aware of execution order and storage, we hope to produce highly performant parallel code that is competitive with Caffe.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-challenge" class="anchor" href="#the-challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The challenge</h3>

<p>Halide is not a Turing-complete language. It is able to describe steps in an image processing pipeline for use on a GPU, but any looping constructs would have to be done in a host language. Additionally, the tools provided by Halide are tailored to image processing operations, so it is not yet known whether it has the expressiveness to implement convolutional neural network code efficiently. If the available constructs are insufficient for our needs, we will extend the Halide compiler to include them. For example, it may be necessary to extend Halide to be aware of NVIDIA's <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuDNN">cuDNN library</a>.</p>

<p>The simplest neural networks enjoy easy parallelization. Many feed-forward neural networks can be evaluated with the composition of three operations: matrix multiplication, vector addition, and the rectifier [ ReLU(x) = \max(x, 0) ]. These operations are very natural to perform on a GPU, with highly performant matrix multiplication having been extensively studied.</p>

<p>Convolutional neural networks add matrix convolution between an image and a kernel. Because this operation is widely used in image processing, we expect that convolutional neural networks are feasible in Halide.</p>

<p>We also expect that optimization efforts will lie in the topology of a deep neural network, in which speed up of the composition of these operations becomes important. Also, training neural networks via backpropagation presents a challenge to locality because the intermediate layer activations need to be saved.</p>

<p>Since Caffe has been tuned and optimized by more than a thousand contributors, it sets a high bar for performance.</p>

<h3>
<a id="resources" class="anchor" href="#resources" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resources</h3>

<p>We will be starting our code from scratch in C++. Caffe and Halide are open source and will serve as references during development.</p>

<p>For information on implementing neural networks, we consult the <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Ebengioy/dlbook/">Deep Learning</a> book by Yoshua Benjio, et al.</p>

<p>For development, we will be able to use ordinary hardware; Halide targets x86/SSE, ARM v7/NEON, CUDA, Native Client, and OpenCL. In order to compete with Caffe, we will use their <a href="http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/performance_hardware.html">benchmarks on NVIDIA GPUs</a>, which include NVIDIA K40, NVIDIA Titan, NVIDIA K20, and NVIDIA GTX 770.</p>
